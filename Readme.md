##Introduction

Have you ever want to write down a piece of fantastic music you heard from street, during a game, in a concert or etc. to record that wonderful feeling? Did you feel it easy to reproduce that music in your mouth, but hard to write down the rhythm from your memory in scores? If so, here our visualing tool will help you then.

Recall your Music in Memory. Reproduce them through the Keyboard. See Notes' Distribution in Timeline. Then Obtain the Music Score.
